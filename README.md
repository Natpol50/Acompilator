# Acompilator [WIP]
A small script aimed to ease code compilation and upload to an arduino uno without too much hassle


## Installation 

Simply download all the files and run the Installer.sh inside the Script folder.
The installer should take care of it by itself.

Just in case you have some memory loss, to run it, simply open the terminal inside the Script folder and type
./Install.sh 



## Usage 

Once installed, type
Acompil -h
This command will get you started.
